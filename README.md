# PythonClass_FinalProject

### This code in this repository was created for the EGN 5932C & EGN 4930 ST: Env Data Science course at Florida Gulf Coast University. 

### The purpose of this project was to utilize Geemap to import and apply Sentinel-2 indices to Lake Okeechobee through the outlet into St. Lucie River. This data was compared to collected data through South Florida Water Management District's DBHYDRO website (https://www.sfwmd.gov/science-data/dbhydro) to try and find a correlation between spectral indices and observed algal blooms. The data was then utilized for machine learning to try and predict the chance of an algal bloom based on collected water quality data. 

### Findings and results of this project should not be interpreted as fact but as preliminary findings and conclusions, as more work needs to be done to validate this data and ensure its accuracy before publication or word of completion.
